# ðŸŒŸ Introduction to React

## ðŸ“Œ What is React?
* React is **not a language**  
* React is **not a framework**  
* React is **not just a technology**  

ðŸ‘‰ React is a **JavaScript library** created by **Facebook in 2013** and later made **open-source in 2015**.  
It is mainly used for building **user interfaces (UI)**, especially for **single-page applications (SPAs)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Virtual DOM in React
* The **Virtual DOM** is an **exact copy (or blueprint)** of the Real DOM.  
* Whenever you **change or update** something on a website, React doesnâ€™t repaint the whole page.  
* Instead, it **re-renders only the changed parts** of the DOM.  
* This makes React **fast, efficient, and lightweight**.

âœ¨ In simple words:  
Virtual DOM helps React update only where the **change is necessary** instead of repainting everything.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Did Facebook Create React?
* On large websites, **a lot of changes happen** frequently.  
* This caused unnecessary **repaints**, even for elements that were not updated.  
* As a result, websites became **slow and heavy**.  
* To solve this problem, **Facebook created React** and introduced the **Virtual DOM**.

## ðŸ“Œ JSX in React

- JSX looks similar to HTML, but with superpowers âœ¨
- It allows us to write JavaScript inside HTML-like code.
- We can perform calculations and logic directly within JSX.
- Example:
 ```bash
 <h1>Hey {2 + 2}</h1>
  ```
- Output:
   `Hey 4`
