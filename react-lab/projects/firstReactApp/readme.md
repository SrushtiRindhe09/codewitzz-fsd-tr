# 🌱 My Simple React Examples

This project is a small practice with **React JS** where I tried 3 basic concepts:
- Embedding expressions in JSX
- Using JavaScript functions inside JSX
- Adding dynamic attributes

---

## 🚀 Steps I Followed

### 1. First, I created a React project using:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app firstReactApp
  cd firstReactApp
  ```
### 2.Then I replaced the code in src/index.js with my examples.

### Finally, I started the project using:
```bash
npm start
```

## 📝 What I Learned

- I used {} inside JSX to show variables or expressions.
- JavaScript functions can be called directly inside JSX.
- Attributes like href can be given values from variables → this makes them dynamic.

## 🎯 Conclusion

- These small examples helped me understand the basics of React JSX.
- Even though it’s simple, it gave me confidence to write and test React code.
- This is my first step toward learning React in a fun and practical way 🚀.
