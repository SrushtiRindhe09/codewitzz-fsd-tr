# 📝 Todo App – My First React Project

This is my very first project in **React JS**.  
The main goal was to understand how React works, how to create components, and also how to upload a project on **GitHub** without errors.

## 🚀 How I Created the Project

1. First, I went to the folder path where I wanted to create the project.  
   Example:  
   ```bash
   cd/react-lab/project
   
2. Then I ran the command:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app project_name

3. After the project was created, I removed all the default code from App.js so I could start fresh.
